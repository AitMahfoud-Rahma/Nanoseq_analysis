In this part i used the Sniffles tool to detect structural variants in .VCF files. 

# Extraction of Structural Variant Information

The sv_types_position.py [sv_types_position.py](sv_types_position.py) script allows you to extract the following information from the VCF files generated by Sniffles:
Chromosome
Position
Structural variant type

# Counting Structural Variant Types

The sv_types.py [sv_types.py](sv_types.py) script extracts the structural variant types from the VCF files and performs a count. The results are saved in a CSV file called sv_types.csv. This file is used to generate pie charts.
