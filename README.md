# Nanoseq_analysis

the (. statistics.sh) command analyzes sequence quality in fastqc_data.txt files and generates a statistics.txt file containing statistics. It extracts information such as file name, number of sequences, longest sequence length, GC percentage and average quality. The script parses all fastqc_data.txt files in the subdirectories and adds the extracted statistics to the end of the (statistics.txt) file.
